         R[DRVC]          |    R[ADCB]
DRVC ----/\/\/\-----------+----/\/\/\---- ADCB

To measure resistance of the DUT:
- DRV0 is driven HIGH (or LOW)
- DRV1 and DRV2 are tri-stated
- DRVC is driven LOW (or HIGH)
- ADCA and ADCB take a reading, store the difference
Assuming that the impedance presented by ADCA and ADCB is much greater than
R[DUT], then:
The current through DUT: I[DUT] = (V[DRV0]-V[DRVC])/(R[DRV0]+R[DUT]+R[DRVC])
We also know that        I[DUT] = (V[ADCA]-V[ADCB])/R[DUT]
Setting the two equations equal:
    (V[DRV0]-V[DRVC])/(R[DRV0]+R[DRVC]+R[DUT]) = (V[ADCA]-V[ADCB])/R[DUT]
Save some typing:
    Rdut := R[DUT]
    Rdrv := R[DRV0]+R[DRVC]
    Vdrv := V[DRV0]-V[DRVC]
    Vadc := V[ADCA]-V[ADCB]
Solving for Rdut:
    Vdrv / (Rdut + Rdrv) = vdac / Rdut
    Vdrv * Rdut = Vadc * (Rdut + Rdrv)
    Vdrv * Rdut = Vadc * Rdut + vdac * Rdrv
    Rdut * (Vdrv - Vadc) = Vadc * Rdrv
    Rdut = Rdrv * Vadc / (Vdrv - Vadc)

## On Autoscaling

If R[DUT] is much smaller than R[DRV0], the voltage (V[ADCA]-V[ADCB]) will be
diminishingly small, leading to inaccurate readings.  By the same token, if
R[DUT] is much larger than R[DRV0], the differential voltage will be near the
upper limits, also leading to inaccurate readings.  To get the most accurate
readings, we want R[DRV] to approximately equal R[DUT].  Thus, we can switch in
DRV0, DRV1, or DRV2 depending on what best matches RDUT.

## On Conductivity

In real-world applications, condictivity probes need to be driven with an AC
signal, specifically with an average of zero volts, in order to prevent
bulk ion transport and deposition on the sensor probes.  Our circuit manages
this by driving DRVn and DRVC opposite polarity half of the time.

We could simply alternate the two, but that could lead to heterodyning with
AC power signals.  Instead, we use a pseudo random sequence to determine the
polarity of one sample to the next.  The only requirement of the PSR is that it
display an average of zero.

## On the selection of Rdrv[n]

For a given Rdrv, the system can take accurate readings over two decades, with
DUT ranging from Rdrv/10 to Rdv*10.  If we use four drive resistors, what's the
best set of values?

Propose:
     31.6 ohms (to read from 3 ohms to 300 ohms) [15 + 15]
     1.0K ohms (to read 100 ohms to 10K ohms) [1K]
    31.6K ohms (to read from 3K ohms to 310K ohms) [33K]
     1.0M ohms (to read from 100K ohms to 10M ohms) [1M]

This gives good overlap in each range and provides a very wide range of values.

## On ADC input impedance

The maximum external input impedance allowed for errors below 1/4 LSB is given
by:

     Rin = ((k - 0.5) / (Fadc * Cadc * ln(2^(N+2)))) - Radc

We also know that:

     Radc = 1.5 (min)
     N = 12 (bits)
     k = # sampling periods = ADC_SMPR1 = ?
     Fadc = ADC clock freq = 15MHz?
     Cadc = internal sample and hold capacitor = 4pF

Our best guess:

    Rin = 1 / (15 * 10^6 * 6 * 10^-12 * 9.7) = 1150

The documents also mention 1ÂµA of leakage on the input.  Across 1M, that could
be a one volt error.

So, this all tells us that we'll want an opamp follower for any drive resistor
greater than 1K.

Replace R[ADCA] and R[ADCB] in the above schematic with a good dual rail-to-rail
opamp.  The TI OPA344 looks like a good option, as does the LMV342 (though that
is only SMT).
